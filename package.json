  "description": "This is a coding exam administered for consideration of employment as a front-end engineer @ Allma (https://allma.io). This exam does not include algorithmic challenges or data structure challenges, but focuses on real-world use cases at Allma. An API output file (tasks.json) includes an API response for a set of tasks to be completed by various users of the system. Your job is to build a lite front-end application that reads this API and displays the output of it in a single page according to a set of use cases.",
